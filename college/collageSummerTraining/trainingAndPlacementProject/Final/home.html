          The world is evolving at a very fast pace. The current scenario
          demands the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn things. It has
          always remained a challenge for academia to produce industry-ready
          people. At UIET, our mission is to produce professionally competent
          engineers by providing value-based and quality education to students
          and to make them adaptable to ever-changing demands and requirements
          of the world. The prime strengths of the institute are the highly
          competent students, dedicated and research-oriented faculty, staff and
          the state of the art infrastructure. Within a short span of time, UIET
          has proved its mettle by securing 59th position among the best
          engineering colleges in India and has set itself apart as an institute
          of repute in North India. We share a wonderful relationship with
          industry as they continue to seek our assistance in various projects
          where our students participate actively. Today, we have a strong
          alumni base with presence in almost every major company of the
          corporate world. We have always fulfilled the expectations of our past
          recruiters and hope to give our best this year also. We encourage all
          private and government sector companies to participate in the
          recruitment process and we are sure that the students recruited will
          play a pivotal role in the growth of the respective organization
